## 🎮 About the Game

You wake up in a mysterious room. A gun lies in front of you. What do you do?

GUNGAME is a turn-based console RPG where you must clear **5 unique rooms** — each with its own challenge — before the locked final door will open and let you escape.

## 💡 Tips

- Always pick up the **medkit** from the Gold Room before entering the Blue Room
- In the Red Room, choosing **not** to attack still lets the enemy hit you — fight back!
- The Black Room timer starts the moment the code is displayed, so read fast
